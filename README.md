# High-dimensional Data Analysis. Innopolis Fall 2018

### Your First Step
This project has [wiki](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/wiki).
As the course develops, useful pages will be generated there, which may be useful to you.

The first thing you need to do is read the recommendations for using the IDE, the compiler and other build tools. This information you can get on the wiki [Toolkit](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/wiki/Toolkit) page.
It will help you make your first CORRECT steps in learning the HDDA and that make life easier.

Further please read the policy of handing over laboratory works and homeworks. You will receive this information on the [Workload](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/wiki/Workload) wiki page.

Since we use github as part of the course, please read the [Py on Git (HowTo)](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/wiki/Py-on-Git-(HowTo)) page. This page provides a minimal step-by-step deployment plan from the C project to github.


Links to the course materials will appear in [README](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/blob/master/README.md), so please check the current changes in this file.

The course materials themselves will be partially laid out in the current repository, or in the Google Drive folder. 
The [link to Google Drive](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_hdda_fall/blob/master/imgs/ahahah.gif) is in the Telegram channel. 
Please don't share the link to Google Drive or to Telegram Channel, because some materials are private intellectual property.

### Course Structure
The average length of a Martian solar day (often called a sol) is 24 h 39 m 35.244147 s (88,775.244147 seconds). So, Mars' solar day is only about 2.7% longer than Earth's. That's why I prefer use Sols.

Below is given a roadmap course. Since the course is actually held for the first time, the card will be replenished on the go.
Each Sol contains lecture, lab session and assignment materials. 

Martian Roadmap:
- [1 Sol: ](lectures/lecture1.pdf)
- [2 Sol: ](lectures/lecture2.pdf)
    - [Lab Session 1](labs/lab2/HDDA.%20Lab%20Session%20%232.ipynb)
    - [Assignment 1](assignments/ha2/README.md)
